      <h2>Assignment</h2>
      <p>
        Use React to create a list interfaces that filter, sorts, and aggregates
        list items.
      </p>
      <h2>Use of Application</h2>
      <p>
        During the 2020 election, I became very aware of the mechanics of the
        electoral college. As states are decided, I wanted to count up the
        electoral college votes of the candidates to see who was closer to the
        270-vote threshold. This app is used to analyze election results by
        allowing the user to sort states by whether they eventually went to
        Trump or Biden, filter by category of electoral votes, and sort by
        population to claim states for their candidate.
      </p>
      <h2>Implementation</h2>

      <h2>Usability Considerations</h2>
      <p>
        The app was made <b>learnable</b> by using standard conventions of list
        interfaces and clear button labels. The app is <b>memorable</b> becuase
        it shows all information the user might need to know. The app is
        <b>efficient</b> due to the "Claim all for Biden", "Claim all for
        Trump", and "Remove states from count" buttons that allow
        high-efficiency users to easily claim states.
