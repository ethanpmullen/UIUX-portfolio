      <h2>Objective</h2>
      <p>
        To design an interface for an emerging startup, create an interactive
        mockup, anad iteratating off of critique. The project was completed with
        a group of 4 UI/UX students.
      </p>
      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Our concept was based on Together, a tablet app video chat designed to
        connect kids to their grandparents and long-distance through activities
        like reading a book and playing games. We created the interface with the
        following goals in mind:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Easy for grandparents without technological experience to learn</li>
        <li>Usable for children without the ability to read</li>
        <li>Inviting and engaging for families</li>
        <li>
          Safe and secure so that parents can control their children's use of
          technology
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        From our original sketch to our current prototype, we’ve received a lot
        of feedback about user flow, design choices, and making each element
        clear and purposeful.
      </p>
      <h2>Sketching</h2>
      <p>
        Our group brainstormed design ideas, exploring multiple alternatives
      </p>
      <img class="img-fluid" src="./images/sketches.png" alt="sketches" />
      <p>We focused on the following screens:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Home screen</b>, where the user can click on a profile picture to
            initiate a call
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p>
            <b>Call screen</b>, where they can video chat and also pull up games
            that live on a shelf on the left
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <p><b>Settings</b>, which are protected from child access</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Critique</h2>
      <p>During our critique, we got the following feedback:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>More specific labeling and directions for the activity icons</li>
        <li>Making the app kid-safe, protecting the settings</li>
        <li>Consider a parental perspective in terms of protecting children</li>
        <li>Show physical differences for font size</li>
        <li>Some settings don't really make sense as buttons</li>
        <li>No clear way to exit from activities</li>
        <li>General compliments on aesthetic and interface</li>
      </ul>
      <p>We made the following updates</p>
      <h3>In call buttons</h3>
      <div style="display: flex">
        <img
          src="images/precall.png"
          class="img-fluid"
          style="width: 50%"
          alt="Call screen before critique"
        />
        <img
          src="images/postcall.png"
          class="img-fluid"
          style="width: 50%"
          alt="Call screen after critique"
        />
      </div>
      <p>
        We added text labeling each button, added contrast to the colors of each
        button, and created an ‘x’ in the description area that allows the user
        to exit the activity.
      </p>
      <h3>Child safety features</h3>
      <img src="images/algebra.png" class="img-fluid" alt="new security lock" />
      <p>
        We wanted to ensure that parents had some control over how kids could
        interact with the app, and after debating possible solutions, we
        included a math problem before granting access to the settings. We
        thought that this would provide enough protection to deter kids, but not
        make it a hassle for grandparents and parents to access, as passwords
        can be confusing and hard to remember.
      </p>
      <h3>Settings clarification</h3>
      <div style="display: flex">
        <img
          src="images/presettings.png"
          class="img-fluid"
          style="width: 50%"
          alt="Settings before critique"
        />
        <img
          src="images/postsettings.png"
          class="img-fluid"
          style="width: 50%"
          alt="Settings after critique"
        />
      </div>
      <p>
        We renamed some settings and included sliders instead of only buttons.
        For example “contact filter” was renamed “can add new contacts”, and
        font size and color contrast are sliders. We also made the changes in
        text size more obvious.
      </p>
