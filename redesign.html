      <h2>Objective</h2>
      <p>
        Analyze one page of a website based on usability and accessibility.
        Then, draft and build and improved version.
      </p>

      <h2>The Website</h2>
      <p>
        <a href="http://www.afpls.org/">Fulton County Library System</a> is the
        central hub for 34 libraries in Fulton County and Atlanta, Georgia.
      </p>

      <h3>Usability Problems</h3>

      <dd>
        The page is cluttered with information
        <ul>
          <li>Too many pictures</li>
          <li>Color palette isn't coordinated</li>
          <li>
            Lack of contrast (both the white and black text on light green
            background are hard to read)
          </li>
          <li>Headers don’t stand out against pictures (databases, etc.)</li>
          <li>Column sizes and spacing are inconsistent</li>
          <li>Use of pictures of text instead of text (on the left column)</li>
        </ul>
      </dd>
      <dt>Learnability</dt>
      <dd>
        Similar action items are not grouped together
        <ul>
          <li>
            For example locations, event calendar, services, and about are all
            navigation bar menu options, news is a box on the homepage
          </li>
          <li>
            Within "books and materials", my account and catalog search are
            grouped together
          </li>
        </ul>
      </dd>
      <dt>Memorability</dt>
      <dd>
        Navigation is not cohesive
        <ul>
          <li>
            It's hard to remember where other pages are located because they're
            so sporadic (in sidebars, nav bars, linked, etc.)
          </li>
          <li>
            Uses drop down menu on top right for "I want to..." instead of
            intuitive design
          </li>
        </ul>
      </dd>

      <dt>Efficiency</dt>
      <dd>
        Heavily used actions are not emphasized
        <ul>
          <li>Coronavirus updates are at the bottom</li>
          <li>Account info is in a menu item and not at the top as expected</li>
          <li>Search is in the middle of the page, should be at the top</li>
        </ul>
      </dd>

      <h3>Accessibility Concerns</h3>
      <dd>
        The Fulton County Library System website has multiple accessibility
        errors and alerts according to WebAIM WAVE. There are a few instances of
        text with very low contrast, which I noticed but was interested that it
        was quantifiably hard to read. Some of the errors were instances of bad
        practice I didn’t notice because I don’t use a screen reader, for
        example: layout table, redundant title text, and redundant links, et
        cetera. In general, the clutter of the website that is apparent when
        looking at it becomes an accessibility concern because it is hard for
        people with different accessibility needs.
      </dd>

      <h2>Low-Fi Mockup</h2>
      <p>
        Layouts consolidate navigation from the original website, focusing on
        the navigation bar at the top and removing the drop down menus and
        sidebars. This makes the website more usable because all actions are
        accessible from the nav bar, so the user knows where to look.
        Additionally, other items of interest are given more emphasis on the
        home page (for example, databse links, news, and search).
      </p>
      <img class="img-fluid" src="images/low-fi.png" alt="low-fi mockup" />

      <h2 class="mt-2">Visual Style Guide</h2>
      <p>
        Color palette was taken from the Fulton County logo (blue and orange),
        yet the orange was shifted toward yellow to be more timeless. Typography
        was chosen to be cohesive to be lively and visually interesting yet
        confident and sleek.
      </p>
      <img
        class="img-fluid"
        src="images/visual-style.png"
        alt="visual style guide"
      />

      <h2>Implementation</h2>
      <a href="https://ancient-headland-15502.herokuapp.com/"
        >Redesign is deployed here</a
      >
      <img
        class="img-fluid"
        src="images/redesignscreenshot.png"
        alt="deployment screenshot"
      />
      <p>
        The validators and accessibility checkers give insight that is
        undetectable to the eye. Even though I learned about best practices
        earlier, using WAVE on my own submission showed me the things I forgot
        about, such as an alt tag here and there.
      </p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p class="mb-5">
        The original library website has many important functions, all of which
        I wanted to make accessible in the redesign, however, with a more
        simplified design, color palette, and fewer photos. The library is not
        trying to sell a product, but serves a more utilitarian purpose. The
        website offers visual interest when appropriate (icons, pictures of
        events), but mainly lets the content breathe so that a user can quickly
        access whatever they need.
