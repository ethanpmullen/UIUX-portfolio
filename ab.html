      <h2>Objective</h2>
      <p>
        Perform an A/B test and statistical analysis on website that sells cacti
      </p>
      <h2>Deploying website</h2>
      <p>
        The website is deployed
        <a href="https://young-plains-52801.herokuapp.com">here.</a> One version
        displays button and item information on the side while the other
        displays information on the bottom:
      </p>
      <h3>Version A</h3>
      <p>Buttons are below images.</p>
      <img src="images/A.png" class="img-fluid" alt="a-test" />
      <h3>Version B</h3>
      <p>Buttons are beside images.</p>
      <img src="images/B.png" class="img-fluid" alt="b-test" />
      <h2>Hypotheses</h2>
      <h3>Time to completion</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Null hypothesis: </b> the button layout does not effect time to
          completion
        </li>

        <li>
          <b>Alternate hypothesis: </b>time to completion is lower when the
          buttons are on the bottom/li>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Return rate</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Null hypothesis: </b>
          the button layout does not effect the times a user visits the cart
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Alternate hypothesis: </b> when buttons are beside the image, users
          will visit the cart more often
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Data collection</h2>
      <p>
        28 participants were sent the link above, which randomly assigns a user
        to either version A or version B. The participants were prompted to fill
        their cart with at least $150 of cacti/succulents. Their button clicks
        and page loads were recorded into a log file, where return rate and time
        to completion.
      </p>
      <p>
        Participants were counted to return if they had ever visited the cart
        and then the home page. Return rate was calculated to be the time, in
        milliseconds, between the user's inital page load and their final
        interaction with the website, whether that be a page load or button
        click.
      </p>
      <span class="summary">
        <img class="chart" src="images/return.png" alt="return rate" />
        <img class="chart" src="images/time.png" alt="time on page" />
      </span>

      <h2>Analysis</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Time to completion rate t score: -0.441</li>
        <li>Time to completion p value: 0.367</li>
        <li>Return rate chi squared: 1.69</li>
        <li>Return rate p value: 0.192</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The p-scores of both datasets indicate that no conclusion can be
        reached. Based on the data, we fail to reject the null hypothesis.
      </p>

      <h2>Takeaways</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>User interaction is varied and difficult to quantify</li>
        <li>
          The environment wasn't natural, so users had no motivation to click on
          the buttons because they weren't spending their own money
        </li>
        <li>
          A/B is a useful tool to gather information about users, which should
          inform design decisions
        </li>
      </ul>
